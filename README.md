User Stories:

  As a user, I should be able to trust in the integrity of the 52-card deck, so that cards are not repeated in dealing.

  As a user, I should be able to trust in the randomization of the dealing of the cards, so that there is no inconsistency or unfair advantage to the user or dealer.

  As a user, I should be able to decide with input whether to stand or hit so that I may strategize based on the values of the cards I am dealt.

  As a user, I should be able to expect the dealer's actions to be dictated by the rules (draw on 16's or less, and stand on all 17's and up) so that I am playing casino-style blackjack against the AI dealer.

  As a user, I should be able to play each round until a conclusion of "lose", "win", "blackjack", or "push", so that the current round may be concluded.
