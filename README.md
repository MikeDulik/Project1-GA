User Stories:

  As a user, I should be able to trust in the randomization of the dealing of the cards as well as the integrity of the 52-card deck, so that there is no inconsistency or unfair advantage to the user or dealer.

  As a user, I should be able to decide with input whether to stand or hit so that I may strategize based on the values of the cards I am dealt.

  As a user, I should be able to expect the dealer's actions to be dictated by the rules (draw on 16 and stand on all 17's) so that I am playing casino-style blackjack against the dealer.

  As a user, I should be able to play each round until a conclusion of "lose", "win", "blackjack", or "push", so that the current round may end, and if chosen, the next round may begin.

  As a user, I should be able to place bets via input so that I have a chance to increase my pot of credits, and apply these new credits to a bet on the next round.
